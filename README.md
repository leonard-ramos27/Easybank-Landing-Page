## My process

### Built with

- HTML Semantics
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript (For the burger menu)

### What I learned

This is my first attempt with making a responsive landing page and so I've learned a lot about using HTML Semantics as well as using CSS Grid and Flexbox for the responsive design. I've also learned about image positioning especially with the placing intro background and the mock up images.

### Continued development

I believe there is a better way on handling the responsive image for the hero section or the intro background and mock up images. Also, I was not able to incorporate the changing of the fill color for the svg icons on hover.
